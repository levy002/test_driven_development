# Solver -  Test Driven Development

In this project we use test driven development (TDD) to plan and implement a class with some methods that solve a series of three common algorithms.


Enjoy!


## Built With

- Ruby
- Terminal
- IRB
- Rubocop (linters)
- TDD via RSPEC


## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.


## Install

In your terminal, navigate to your current directory and run this code

`https://github.com/levy002/test_driven_development.git`

Locate the directory in your file explorer

`cd test_driven_development`

Install Rubocop

`bundle install`

## Run Linters:

### To run rubocop we use:

`rubocop`

### To autocorrect offenses with rubocop we use:

`rubocop --auto-correct-all` or
`rubocop -A`


## Usage

  Navigate to the file `solver.rb` to view the following algorithms:

    * Factorials
    * Reverse a String
    * Fizzbuzz

  Navigate to the `spec` directory to view and Run TEST files for the above algorithms.


## Testing

  Install the testing library 'rspec' with the following command:
  `gem install rspec`
  
  Then within the projects working directory run test using the command `rspec` in the terminal.

Have fun viewing methods that were created through a Test Driven Development first approach!
